Project Title: Simple Inventory Management System

Description:
Create a console-based inventory management app for a small store. It allows users to:
- Add items
- View items
- Update item details
- Delete items
- Save/load data to a file

Features to Implement:

1. Item Struct/Class
   - ID (auto-incremented)
   - Name
   - Quantity
   - Price

2. Core Functionalities
   - Add new item
   - View all items
   - Search item by name or ID
   - Edit item (e.g., change price or quantity)
   - Delete item

3. File Operations
   - Save inventory to a .txt or .csv file
   - Load inventory from a file on startup

4. Simple Menu System
   - Looping menu in the console
   - Input validation

Tools/Concepts to Practice:
- C++ Classes & Objects
- Vectors or arrays
- File I/O (fstream)
- Basic error handling
- Input validation
- Separation of concerns (header files vs. logic)

Bonus Challenges (optional):
- Sort items (e.g., by name or price)
- Add unit tests with a framework like Catch2
- Build a simple GUI using Qt (stretch goal)
